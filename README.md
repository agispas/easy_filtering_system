# [Easy content filtering]() - [jQuery]()

Many times when I had to implement a live search and a filtering system, I had to use plugins which were way too extensive and bloated with tons of features and many pages of documentation. 
There are plenty of plugins which will do these things, some of them are free and also widely supported, I’m not trying to show you just another filtering system.

This is a  basic way to create a filtering system using a live search plugin with just few lines of code. 

So, if you’re looking for a full list of features, functionalities, animations, event handlers, there are plugins which can do that, this article is not about that.

### Let’s begin!

We will use HideSeek which is a simple, yet customizable jQuery plugin for live search, is compatible with IE7+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and jQuery 1.8.1, 1.9.1, 1.11.0, 2.1.0. and supports highlighting, custom message, navigation, initialization via data attribute and custom events.
Configuring it is pretty simple, here’s the default usage: use this template, choose one of the following options to get started:
```
$(‘#search’).hideseek();

```
